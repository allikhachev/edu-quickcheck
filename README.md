Property-based testing with junit-quickcheck and simple examples

## What is QuickCheck? 

QuickCheck is a library for random testing of program properties. 
The programmer provides a specification of the program, in the form of properties 
which functions should satisfy, and QuickCheck then tests that the properties hold 
in a large number of randomly generated cases. QuickCheck provides combinators to 
define properties, observe the distribution of test data, and define test data generators.
